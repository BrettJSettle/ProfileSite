![White Rabbit]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/arctic-hare.jpg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first post of my new blog, the Albus Lepus! In latin, the phrase *albus lepus* translates to "white rabbit", a nickname given to me for my near-albino appearance and quickness (on roller blades).  The first person to use the latin translation mistakenly called me *albus lupus*, which actually translates to "white wolf".  It's unnerving to switch from predator to prey so suddenly. I suppose there's a lesson in there somewhere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blog is an extension of [The Settle Project](http://www.thesettleproject.com), and I hope to use it to better document my progress as a software developer.  I'll be attempting to submit at least one post each week about programming projects, work stories, movie reviews, or anything that seems worth mentioning.

So stay tuned for the first actual post! I've got plenty to talk about.  In the meantime, here are some tidbits about me:

- I would voluntarily exchange my feet for prosthetic roller skates
- When I'm not roller skating, I'm writing code
- I've never lived outside of Southern California
- My twin brother is in the Mathematics PhD program at Carnegie Mellon, PA, and my older sister teaches K-6 near Camp Pendleton, CA
- I was named me after [Brett Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Hull), the hockey player
- I like to watch movies while I work. See [my list](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur77436581/ratings?opfrule=httpDefault)
