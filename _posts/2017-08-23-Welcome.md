![White Rabbit]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/arctic-hare.jpg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first post of my blog! Hopefully I can make the most of these weekly paragraphs to document my progress as a software developer, and as an individual. I'll be attempting to submit at least one post each week about programming projects, work stories, movie reviews, or anything that seems worth mentioning.  If you have ideas for projects, or movies you think I should review, send them to me!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am choosing the arctic hare as my blog mascot in honor of my favorite spirit animal and nickname, *Albus Lepus*. In latin, the phrase *albus lepus* translates to "white rabbit", an alias I earned for my near-albino appearance and quickness (on roller blades).  The first person to use the latin translation mistakenly called me *albus lupus*, which actually translates to "white wolf".  Only now realizing the mistake, it's a bit unnerving to switch from predator to prey. I suppose there's a lesson in there somewhere.

Stay tuned for the first actual post! I've got plenty to talk about.  In the meantime, here are some tidbits about me:

- I would voluntarily exchange my feet for prosthetic roller skates
- When I'm not roller skating, I'm writing code
- I've never lived outside of Southern California
- My twin brother is in the Mathematics PhD program at Carnegie Mellon, PA, and my older sister teaches K-6 near Camp Pendleton, CA
- I was named me after [Brett Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Hull), the hockey player
- I like to watch movies while I work. See [my list](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur77436581/ratings?opfrule=httpDefault)
