Hey, my name is Brett Settle and this is my site!  I created the Albus Lepus as a simple hub to talk about my github projects and other miscellaneous thoughts. If you want to know where the name comed from, or what I have planned for the site, see the [first blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.posts.first.url }}).  For more information on my projects and some fun web-apps, checkout [The Settle Project](http://thesettleproject.com).
