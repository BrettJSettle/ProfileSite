## Hello, my name is Brett

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my website!  My home has always been Southern California, even though I'm not much of a beach person. I've lived in Topanga Canyon, Thousand Oaks, Irvine, and San Diego, although I hope my next move will lead me out of the Golden State.  My most defining hobbies are programming and hockey, both of which I picked up in High School.  Away from the computer and the hockey rink, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and binging movies/TV shows.  For more information on my projects and some fun web-apps, checkout [CodeCurl]({{ site.baseurl }}/codecurl).

## Welcome to The Settle Project

```
This is my website.
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created The Settle Project as a hub for my personal projects, experiences, and other miscellaneous thoughts. While much of my life is spent behind a computer, I will likely only be updating this site when I finish a new project or find something really interesting to share.
