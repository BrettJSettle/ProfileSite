## Hey, my name is Brett Settle

Welcome to my website!  The Settle Project was created as a hub for my personal projects, experiences, and other miscellaneous thoughts.  My home has always been Southern California, even though I'm not much of a beach person. I've lived in Topanga Canyon, Thousand Oaks, Irvine, and San Diego, although I hope my next move will lead me out of the Golden State.  My hobbies include programming and hockey, both of which I started in High School.  I also enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and binging movies.  For some more information about me, see the [first blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.posts.first.url }}).  For more information on my projects and some fun web-apps, checkout [my projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
