## Welcome to The Settle Project

```
This is my website.
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created The Settle Project as a hub for my personal projects, experiences, and other miscellaneous thoughts. While much of my life is spent behind a computer, I will likely only be updating this site when I finish a new project or find something really interesting to share.

### About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in late September in 1995, along with my twin brother Landon.  Since then, I've lived in Topanga Canyon, Thousand Oaks, Irvine, and San Diego. I hope my next move will lead me out of the California, preferrably somewhere less sunny.  My most defining hobbies are programming and hockey, both of which I picked up in High School.  Away from the computer and the hockey rink, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and binging movies/TV shows.  For more information on my projects and some fun web-apps, checkout [CodeCloud]({{ site.baseurl }}/codecloud).
