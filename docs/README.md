# [The Settle Project](https://brettjsettle.github.io/thesettleproject)

The Settle Project is a personal website to store my projects, blog, and anything else worth sharing.  It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and currently hosted through github-pages, with links to projects at [thesettleproject.com](http://thesettleproject.com), an Amazon EC2 instance for webapps outside of Github pages.
