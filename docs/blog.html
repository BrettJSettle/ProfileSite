        <!--<p><img src="https://mz-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photo/file/304138/medium_ab34593e5d50ee9d40cacc0c171b4748-goon_last_of_the_enforcers_ver3.jpg" alt="Image" />
    Hooray! A review about a movie based on my favorite sport, hockey.  Goon: Last of the Enforcers is, at its core, modern day Slapshot: a real homage to the classic hockey comedy. It’s a tough task to emulate the satire that synonymized hockey and fighting, but the Goon films are giving it their best shot.  With plenty of blood, family values, and nonsense hockey, I think they fill the gap.

    My Dad is correct that no one can replace Paul Newman’s sass, but the Goon movies switch it up by focusing on wannabe-Hansen-brother Doug Glatt, played by Seann William Scott, a bouncer turned hockey player with more toes than brain cells.  Seriously, you’d think he was the dullest skate on the ice, but almost every player in the movie is brain damaged.  We owe that glorious dialog to Jay Baruchel, who also has a minor role in the movie as the uncomfortably raunchy best friend — he’s played this character so many times in these witless comedies that it’s almost uncomfortable to go back and watch How To Train Your Dragon.  Goon falls right into that category with some simple, quotable moments.

    A little plot synopsis for those who skipped the first Goon (and who can blame you).  Our dumbass protagonist is a brick-wall bouncer with a sleezy best friend and overbearing parents (y’know, like high school).  Some guy sees him kicking ass and recruits him to play hockey, despite the fact that he’s never worn skates before.  Cue montage… yadda yadda yadda… imagine Happy Gilmore without Adam Sandler… the team starts to win somehow… girl crushes on abusive hockey player (so hot!)… aaaaaaand denouement!  The antagonist arrives in the form of X-Men Wolverines brother, Liev Schreiber!  An hour of thinking “When will they get to the real hockey?” and right when they do it goes back to being a Boxing movie.  In the end our hero prevails and gets the girl and we all go home. Clap clap. Good comedy. Moving on with our lives. Nope!
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dgil6B2.gif" alt="This is actually fucking happening" />
    Goon 2 shows up out of nowhere because Jay Baruchel has a crapton of money and a disturbing sense of humor (and a <a href="https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/hab-at-heart-jay-baruchel/c-726593">love for hockey</a>.  Couldn’t he just sit around and get high with Seth Rogen (and not make a movie about it. Looking at you, This is the End).  This time our protagonist meets a new pair of fists, bearded psychopath Anders Cain, played by Wyatt Russel (from 22 Jump Street, I guess??) and gets beaten to a pulp in the first game, retiring his right arm from the sport just in time to stay home with his pregnant wife.  And the bearded psycho becomes team captain (because that’s how captain works in the NHL).  With Doug working in an insurance company’s basement, the team starts losing.
    Then, in a Rocky-esque comeback, Doug asks old-rival Liev Schreiber to teach him how to left hook, and escapes the monotony of his safe job to punch some dudes on ice.  He tries to appease his wife by avoiding fights but that’s not how hockey works, is it? More punching, more splattering blood. That’s hockey!
    All in all, Goon 2 tries to skate by like a regular movie by hinting at some life lessons: Family comes first, never give up, teamwork makes the dream work, and most importantly, fighting won’t actually solve all your problems.  I’d say it does a fine job, but really it’s just an hour and a half of dumb characters and uncomfortable raunchy joke scenes. Which, to be honest, is all we really expected.

For those of you that haven’t been in a hockey locker room, this is not actually a poor representation.</p>
